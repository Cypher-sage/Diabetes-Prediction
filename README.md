# Diabetes-Prediction

👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm a final-year Computer Science student passionate about using machine learning and data science to solve real-world problems. This project is a part of my journey to explore healthcare analytics through AI. The Diabetes Prediction Model leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on medical attributes.

I've implemented this using Python, with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data processing, model building, and visualization. The goal is to build a simple, interpretable, and effective predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis.

I'm constantly learning and open to feedback or collaboration. Feel free to fork the repo, raise issues, or connect with me!
